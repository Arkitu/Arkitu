  Hi, I'm Arkitu and I'm working with python and javascript (node.js).
  I code since my dad offered me my first pc on linux and I discovered Scratch.
  As I was on linux, I always try to modify my environment (many hour losted to
  have differents wallpapers on each of my desktop). I often work with
  Raspberry pi.
